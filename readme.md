Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo contains a single script called run_analysis.R.  This script will:
* Set the working directory and read the necessary files
* Add columns for subject and activity
* Label the columns of data sets with friendlier, descriptive names
* Combine train and test datasets
* Replace numeric values in activity column with appropriate descriptive activity names
* Create a second, tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Additional information about the variables and transformations can be found in the codebook.md file.
